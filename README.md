This is a simple news archiver using the Hacker News API. This project is based off two different tutorials I found on this site https://www.robinwieruch.de/

It uses Firebase's backend as a service with Firestore as the database. Packages I used for this include the standard React stack of React/Redux/Router. I used Material-UI for most of the design.
